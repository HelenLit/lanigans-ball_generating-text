# lanigans-ball_generating-text
This is my first project, where I prepare data and build models for text generation. 

The dataset is the lyrics of [*Lanigan's Ball*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanigan%27s_Ball), a traditional Irish song. I split it per line then use the `Tokenizer` class to build the word index dictionary.
